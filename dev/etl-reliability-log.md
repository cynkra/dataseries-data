# ETL reliability log

A running journal of ETL reliability incidents (timeouts, cancellations, broad
source outages) and the candidate fixes we've considered — **not** a spec for a
fix we've committed to.

The point is to be evidence-driven. Each incident here is bounded mitigation
already shipped (or none) plus the open question it raises. We deliberately
**don't** build the big robustness solution yet: the right design depends on
which failure mode actually recurs. A broad `admin.ch` outage that happens once a
quarter needs a different (cheaper, or no) fix than one that hits weekly, or than
a slow creep of per-source parser breaks. So we log, watch, and revisit the
"Candidate solutions" section once the pattern is clear.

If you're here because the ETL just timed out again: add an entry to **Incident
log** (template below), check it against the existing entries, and only then ask
whether the pattern now justifies one of the candidate solutions.

## How to add an entry

Copy this template to the top of the Incident log (newest first):

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — one-line symptom

- **Run:** <run id / link>, trigger (schedule|dispatch), conclusion.
- **Symptom:** what was observed.
- **Root cause:** the actual mechanism, with numbers if you have them.
- **Why mitigations didn't catch it:** which existing guard was supposed to help and why it didn't.
- **Blast radius:** what data/alerts were affected.
- **Action taken this time:** what we did to recover (often: just re-ran).
- **Pattern bucket:** broad-outage | single-host-outage | parser-break | runner/infra | other.
```

## Decision status

**Open — collecting evidence (since 2026-06-08).** No structural fix committed.
Current posture: recover by re-running; record the incident here. Revisit when
the "What would change our mind" thresholds below are crossed.

## Candidate solutions (considered, not decided)

Captured so the analysis isn't re-derived each time. Tiers are cost/risk, low to
high. See the 2026-06-08 incident for why the *per-source* caps we already have
don't bound a *broad* outage.

**Tier A — cheap, targeted, no architecture change:**

- **Per-host circuit breaker.** After host H fails K times this run, short-circuit
  H's remaining sources instantly instead of re-paying the full timeout each.
  Directly kills the cascade (outages correlate by host). Needs host attribution
  surfaced into `.try_fetch` (today it only sees a label + a lazy promise; the
  error message does carry `[host]`).
- **Don't retry pure connection failures.** `req_retry(retry_on_failure = TRUE)`
  dials a dead host `max_tries` times. Backoff/retry is for 429/5xx
  (alive-but-throttled, the PX-Web reason); it does nothing for a connect timeout.
  Splitting the two cuts a dead-host cost ~5× (one connect attempt, not four).
- **Global soft-deadline → partial success.** Once total run elapsed crosses
  ~22 min, stop *starting* fetches, mark the rest `skipped: not-attempted
  (deadline)`, and fall through to write the partial catalog + `run.json`. Turns a
  hard `cancelled` (which writes nothing and reports nothing) into a graceful,
  precisely-reported partial run. Must distinguish `skipped: failed` from
  `skipped: not-attempted` so deadline-skips don't look like parser breaks.
- **Gate the in-process retry pass on time-remaining.** The `RETRY_SLEEP` (180s) +
  refetch pass helps an *isolated* transient blip but *adds* to the budget during
  a *broad* outage — skip it if we're already past ~20 min.

**Tier B — structural isolation (the deferred "Tier 2"):**

- **Provider matrix in `etl.yml`.** One CI job per provider/host, each with its own
  30-min budget; an aggregation job merges + commits + runs health. A SECO outage
  blows only the SECO job; the rest stay green and fresh, and the failure is
  self-attributing. Plumbing is half-built already (`build(only=)` + `.ONLY`).
  Cost: artifact passing, a merge/commit job, partial-failure commit semantics.

**Tier C — highest performance, highest risk:**

- **Parallelize fetches within R** (`httr2::req_perform_parallel` / `mirai`).
  Overlaps idle network wait; a 16-min run could drop to ~3–4 min. But the
  fetchers are bespoke (some chunk internally), concurrent error handling is
  harder, and PX-Web/DAM throttle under burst (429) — would need per-host
  concurrency caps or you trade timeouts for throttling.

**Recommendation on file (if/when we act):** Tier A trio (circuit breaker +
no-retry-on-connect + soft-deadline) first — ~40–60 lines, no architectural risk,
kills the cascade and makes every future timeout a graceful reported partial run.
Tier B when per-provider isolation becomes a deliberate goal. Tier C only if raw
speed becomes a goal in itself. Bumping `timeout-minutes` 30→45 is a temporary
cushion *alongside* a real fix, not a fix.

## What would change our mind (revisit thresholds)

Act on a candidate solution when one of these crosses:

- **Broad outage recurs ≥ ~monthly** (or twice in a quarter) → ship Tier A.
- **Any single broad outage refreshes nothing for > ~1 day** (re-run also fails) →
  ship Tier A's soft-deadline at minimum (partial success beats all-or-nothing).
- **Failures stop correlating by host** (independent per-source breaks dominate) →
  circuit breaker won't help; reconsider toward per-source budgets / parser tests.
- **We want per-provider attribution / isolation as a feature** → Tier B.
- **Total runtime itself becomes a constraint** (not just outage tails) → Tier C.

## Incident log

### 2026-06-08 — 30-min timeout from a broad `admin.ch` outage

- **Run:** [27132839583](https://github.com/cynkra/dataseries-data/actions/runs/27132839583),
  manual dispatch, **cancelled** at the `timeout-minutes: 30` cap.
- **Symptom:** job ran the full 30 min and was killed mid-build; the R process was
  still fetching when terminated. A follow-up `etl-failure` issue (#3) opened; no
  data refreshed.
- **Root cause:** broad *transient* outage of Swiss federal infrastructure — SECO
  (`seco.admin.ch`), FFA finance (`data.finance.admin.ch`), and ~9 FSO/BFS
  endpoints (`pxweb.bfs.admin.ch`, `dam-api.bfs.admin.ch`) all connect-timed-out at
  once. Each dead source costs `connecttimeout 15s × max_tries 4 + backoff
  (2+4+8) ≈ 74s`. ~13 dead sources × 74s ≈ 16 min of pure failure, on top of
  ~14 min of healthy fetches → > 30 min. The hosts were reachable again ~1 h later
  (today's 09:51 scheduled run had succeeded), confirming a brief upstream blip.
- **Why mitigations didn't catch it:** the 2026-06-06 hardening caps each source's
  wall-clock (`connecttimeout` + `req_retry(max_seconds=180)` + `setTimeLimit(240)`),
  and it held — every source failed in ~74s, well under 240s. But **per-source caps
  don't bound the *aggregate*.** With a single sequential `build()` over ~70
  sources and no global budget, the run cost is the *sum* of the failures, and a
  broad multi-host outage makes that sum exceed the job budget.
- **Blast radius:** zero data refreshed that cycle (a `cancelled` job writes no
  `catalog.json` / `run.json`, so `skip_issues.sh` never ran → no precise
  per-source reporting, only the blunt `etl-failure` #3). Issue #2
  (`ch_adecco_sjmi` skip, from the 09:51 run) stayed open because the rerun never
  reached the skip-closer.
- **Action taken this time:** re-ran ~1 h later
  ([27135765841](https://github.com/cynkra/dataseries-data/actions/runs/27135765841)) →
  success in ~16 min, **zero skips**, 70 datasets, data committed. Issue #2
  auto-closed (adecco fetched cleanly, 353 rows). Issue #3 closed manually (the
  `etl-failure` step has no close-on-success branch).
- **Pattern bucket:** broad-outage (multi-host, transient).
- **Note:** also the 2nd/3rd timeout of this shape — 2026-06-05 (cancelled, the
  incident that prompted the 06-06 per-source hardening) and 2026-06-07 (cancelled,
  30m22s) fit the same broad-`admin.ch`-outage pattern. So this is the **3rd in
  ~3 days** at time of writing — worth watching closely against the monthly
  threshold above.
